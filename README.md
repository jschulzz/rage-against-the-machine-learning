# Rage Against The Machine Learning
A Machine Learning project that works with artist names and genres

This is a side project I've been working on that utilizes the Keras Machine Learning Library for Python (additionally TensorFlow to utilize GPU calculations). It uses the Spotify API to fetch a list of artists and their matching genres, and trains with that data to identify patterns. I hope to try to guess genres based on a given artist's name. Additionally, I might to use GANs to generate some artists in a genre.

The end goal would be some sort of game, with several gamemodes. One where users try to identify what names are real and what are generated, one where they enter a name and the software tries to identify the genre, etc.
