# Rage Against The Machine Learning
A Machine Learning project that works with artist names and genres

This is a side project I've been working on that utilizes the Keras Machine Learning Library for Python (additionally Theano to utilize GPU calculations). It uses the Spotify API to fetch a list of artists, songs titles, and genres, and trains with that data to identify patterns. Depending on how the setup is, it could train to predict artists and song titles within that specific genre, or identifying . 

The end goal would be some sort of game, with several gamemodes. One where users try to identify what names are real and what are generated, one where they enter a name and the software tries to identify the genre, etc.
